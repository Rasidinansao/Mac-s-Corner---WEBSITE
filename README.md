# Mac-s-Corner---WEBSITE
Its our project defense in "Human Computer Interaction (HCI)" subject.
4/26/23 - As of now I know how to construct the HTML and I need to learn more about CSS. To enhance more my understanding of the proper way of designing a functionable website.

The site feature have simple navigation such as HOME, PRODUCTS, ABOUT US, and FEEDBACK.
What I like the most is the footer where I put icons that link into its purpose.

I have a classmate who's expert on this field, And ask if he could teach me more about html and css.
Because soon I will create my own html/css website about my little printing business.
